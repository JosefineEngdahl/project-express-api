# Project Express API
My first API built using Node js and Express.

## The problem

The API has 4 routes:
ROUTE 1: "/nominations" to view all data
ROUTE 2: "/year/2010" to view all movies with nominations from a specific year
ROUTE 3: "/nominations/avatar" to view a specific movie
ROUTE 4: "/year/2010?win=true" to view won movies in a specific year

## View it live
